  CloneWorks
================================================================================

Please send your questions and bug reports to: jeff.svajlenko@gmail.com.  I am
happy to assist you in using CloneWorks.

Please refer to the publication for additional details.  A link to the paper is
provided at jeff.svajlenko.com/cloneworks.  There is also a tool demonstration
video provided.

Setup
-----

CloneWorks can be used on Linux and other unix-like systems.  It has been tested
on the latest Ubuntu and OS X.  It should also work on Cygwin, but the input
builder is slower due to process creation being slower on Windows.  We plan to
support Windows 10 "redstone" update with its native Ubuntu kernel.

CloneWorks requires FreeTXL 10.6 or later, which can be download from:

	http://www.txl.ca/

CloneWorks requires configuration for your available memory.  By defualt the 
input builder is set to use up to 2GB of memory, and the clone detector up to
4GB of memory.  These can be modified by editing the cwbuild and cwdetect
scripts.  The input builder is probably fine with 2GB unless you receive an out
of memory error from the JVM.  The clone detector should be set for your
available memory, leaving room for system usage.

By defualt, CloneWorks must be executed from its installation directory.  To
run CloneWorks from another directory, the cwbuild and cwdetect scripts must
be modified with 'INSTALL_DIR=...' set to the install directory (absolute path).
If the installation directory is specified, cwbuild and cwdetect can also be
added to the PATH variable for execution anywhere.

The TXL scripts need to be compiled for your computer.  Enter the txl/ directory
and run make.



Testing CloneWorks
------------------
Once installed, CloneWorks can be tested by executing the following commands in
the installation directory:

./cwbuild -i example/JHotDraw54b1/ -f example/JHotDraw.files -b example/JHotDraw.fragments -l java -g function -c type3_conservative
./cwdetect -i example/JHotDraw.fragments -o example/JHotDraw.clones -s 0.7

This performs Type-3 clone detection on JHotDraw.  The clones are in the file
example/JHotDraw.clones, the code fragments are in example/JHotDraw.fragments,
and the mapping of ID to source-file paths are in example/JHotDraw.files.



Using CloneWorks
----------------

The input builder (cwbuild) is used to prepare the source code for clone
detection, which is performed by the clone detector (cwdetect).

    Input Builder
    -------------
The input builder has the following usage:

usage: cwbuild -i <path> -f <path> -b <path> -l <str [str2 st3 ...]> -g <str> -c <config> [-t <num>] [-mil <num>] [-mal <num>] [-mit <num>] [-mat <num>]
CloneWorks-InputBuilder - CloneWorks input builder.
 -i,--input <path>                    Input subject system.  Either the root directory of the system, or a file containing
                                      a list of source file paths.
 -f,--fileids <path>                  File to write the FileID<->FilePath mapping to.
 -b,--blocks <path>                   File to write the parsed blocks to.
 -l,--language <str [str2 st3 ...]>   The language of the input system.  One of: {java,c,cpp,cs,python}.
 -g,--granularity <str>               The block granularity.  One of: {block,function,file}.
 -c,--configuration <config>          The configuration file.  Name of a file in INSTALL_DIR/config/.
 -t,--num-threads <num>               The number of threads to use per execution task.  Default is number of available cores.
 -mil,--min-lines <num>               Minimum code fragment size in (original) source lines.
 -mal,--max-lines <num>               Maximum code fragment size in (original) source lines.
 -mit,--min-tokens <num>              Minimum code fragment size in (original, pre-processing) parsed tokens.
 -mat,--max-tokens <num>              Maximum code fragment size in (original, pre-processing) parsed tokens.

You must specify the directory of source code to process, a file to output a
mapping of the source file paths to IDs, and a file to output the code fragments
to.  The language(s) of the soruce files of interest must be specified, as well
as the code granularity for extraction.  The configuration file from the config/
directory needs to also be supplied.

Optionally, the minimum and maximum size of the code fragments to consider (by
source line and terms) can also be specified.  The target number of threads per 
task can also be provided, by default the number of available cores is used.

The input builder's code-fragment processors, term splitting and term processors
are specified in the configuration file.  The name of the configuration file
must be provided.  The configuration files are stored in the config/ directory,
including a template and some sample configurations for generic clone detection
with the first three clone types.

For information on implementing your own code-fragment processors and term
processors please see the documentation and examples in the cfprocessors/ and
termprocessors/ directory.



    Clone Detector
    --------------

The clone detector has the following usage:

usage: cwdetect -i <file> -o <file> -s <ratio> [-p <num>] [-t <num>] [-mil <num>] [-mal <num>] [-mit <num>] [-mat <num>] [-ps]
Clone detection with CloneWorks.
 -i,--input <file>                   File containing blocks produced by thrifty-builder.
 -o,--output <file>                  File to output clones to.
 -s,--min-similarity <ratio>         Minimum clone similarity.
 -p,--partition-mode <num>           Run using index-partitioning mode with the specified maximum partition size in code blocks.
                                     Use when index size exhausts available memory.
 -t,--num-threads <num>              Number of execution threads to use per task.  Defaults to number of cores.
 -mil,--min-lines <num>              Minimum clone size in (original) source lines.
 -mal,--max-lines <num>              Maximum clone size in (original) source lines.
 -mit,--min-tokens <num>             Minimum clone size in (original, pre-processing) parsed tokens.
 -mat,--max-tokens <num>             Maximum clone size in (original, pre-processing) parsed tokens.
 -ps,--pre-sorted                    Indicates input blocks are pre-sorted, and GTF-sorting should be skipped.
                                     This makes clone detection with pre-sorted blocks more efficient.  If the
                                     blocks are not pre-sorted, or are sorted incorrectly, this can cause false
                                     negatives.  Skipping sorting on pre-sorted blocks can improve performance.

You must specify the code fragment file to detect clones within, a file to
output the clones to, and the minimum clone similarity threshold in range
[0.0,1.0].  Optionally, the minimum and maximimum clone sizes can be specified.

If there are too many code fragments to fit in memory, then the partitioned
partial indexes pappraoch can be eanbled with the "-p" flag, including the
maximum number of code fragments in each partition.  This number needs to be
found experimentally.  However, the first step is to load the code fragmnets
into memory, so an out of memory exception should be encountered early if it is
going to happen.

In our expirence, we found we can comfortably load 500000 code fragments into
memory given a Java heap size of 8GB, with actual usage not exceeding approx.
6GB.  This option is not needed for small inputs.

The "-ps" flag can be used to skip sorting the blocks.  This is for use when the
code-fragments are pre-sorted, or where the code fragments only have a single
term (as is the case with our Type-1 and Type-2 configurations).  Sorting the
code fragment's terms is not the expensive part of clone detection, so its safer
just to skip this flag unless you know your blocks are sorted properly and need
the small performance boost by skipping sorting.

Clones are found in the output file in the following format:

10,40,50,20,60,70

This indicates a clone pair between lines 40-50 (inclusive) in source file 10
and lins 60-70 (inclusive) in source file 20.  The mapping of IDs to source
paths are in the fileids file produced by the input builder.
